# Release Note for V. 1.6.0-cap13

## What is new? 
#### Circuit Breaker Patter.
Spring Boot provide some in build APIs to check circuit breaker status. 
`/actuator/heath`,`/actuator/circuitbreakerevent`
additional circuit breaker can be integrated wit public metrics so that it can be monitored from any system
in this project will use Prometheus as monitoring tool.
this chapter will implement following setting:
- `ringBufferSizeInClosedState = 5` and `failureRateThreshold = 50%`, meaning that if three or more of the last five calls are faults, 
  then the circuit will open.
- `waitInterval = 10000` and `automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled = true`, meaning that the circuit breaker will keep the circuit open 
  for 10 seconds and then transition to the half-open state.
- `ringBufferSizeInHalfOpenState = 3`, meaning that the circuit breaker will decide whether the circuit shall be opened 
  or closed based on the three first calls after the circuit has transitioned to the half-open state. 
  Since the failureRateThreshold parameters are set to 50%, the circuit will be open again if two or all three calls fail. 
  Otherwise, the circuit will be closed. 
- `ignoreExceptions = InvalidInputException` and NotFoundException, 
   meaning that our two business exceptions will not be counted as faults in the circuit breaker.
- `maxRetryAttempts = 3`: We will make a maximum of two retry attempts.
- `waitDuration= 1000`: We will wait one second between retries.
- `retryExceptions = InternalServerError`: We will only trigger retries on InternalServerError exceptions, that is, 
   when HTTP requests respond with a 500
- How we implemented:
  Add a starter dependency for Resilience4j in the build file.
  Add annotations in the source code where the circuit breaker and retry mechanism shall be applied.
  Add configuration that controls the behavior of the circuit breaker and retry mechanism.

 ## Documentation:

## Added Feature:
1. Setting up repository where all configuration will be placed.
2. Setting up config-server.
3. Setting up config client to all services.
4. Setting up authentication mode to support config-server
7. Fixed docker-compose container dependencies.

## Setup
 check out ```config_repo/``` will see all configuration available and profiles.
### Manual Test
1. clone project
2. created self-signed certificated.
    ````shell
        mkdir -p spring-cloud/authorization-server/src/main/resources/keystore
        mkdit keystore
        
        # both directories execute below command.
        # leaves all by default when keytool ask.
        keytool -genkeypair -alias localhost -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore edge.p12 -validity 3650
    ````
3. build project and build docker images:
    ````shell
    ./gradlew build && docker-compose build
    ````
### Automated Test
1. Running all services.
   ````shell
   ./test_them_all.sh start
   ````
   Now our Eureka server has been secured by Oauth2 you will need to provide user and password if you want to see 
   all the service registered `http://localhost:8443/eureka/web` eureka-server. Notice we are 
   getting access to eureka server from port :8443 this is our new Age server and the routes we set up.
   
2. Acquiring access token using **password grant flow**:
    ````shell
   #writer
   curl -k https://writer:secret@localhost:8443/oauth/token -d grant_type=password -d username=magnus -d password=password -s | jq .
   export ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJ...SyIlQ
   #Reader
   curl -k https://reader:secret@localhost:8443/oauth/token -d grant_type=password -d username=magnus -d password=password -s | jq .
   ````
3. Acquiring access token using **implicit grant flow**:
   - **Writer:**
   in the browser ``https://localhost:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=reader&redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri&scope=product:read&state=48532``
   type user ```magnus``` and password ``password`` Authorize the process it will redirect to a link page:
   ``http://my.redirect.uri/#access_token=eyJh...C8pw&token_type=bearer&state=48532&expires_in=599999999&jti=8956b38b-36ea-4888-80dc-685b49f20f91``
   notice it has the access token yo can use it from here as authenticated user.
   - **Reader:** ``https://localhost:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=writer&redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri&scope=product:read+product:write&state=95372``
4. Acquiring acces token using **Code grant flow:** the most secure in OAuth 2.0.
   - **Reader:** ``https://localhost:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=reader&redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri&scope=product:read&state=35725``
   will answer with ``rect.uri/?code=T2pxvW&state=72489`` extract the code and ``CODE=T2pxvW`` now:
   ````shell
    curl -k https://reader:secret@localhost:8443/oauth/token \
    -d grant_type=authorization_code \
    -d client_id=reader \
    -d redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri \
    -d code=$CODE -s | jq .
    ````
   will return a access token.
   - **Writer:** ``https://localhost:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=writer&redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri&scope=product:read+product:write&state=72489``
5. Calling protected API using access token.
   ````shell
    ACCESS_TOKEN={a-reader-access-token}
    curl https://localhost:8443/product-composite/2 -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -i
   ````
