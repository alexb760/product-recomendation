# Release Note for V. 1.0.4-cap11

## What is new? 
#### Securing access to APIs.
- We are implementing OAuths and openID connect authentication and authorized user and client app
  to access our APIs.
- Following all the needed step to complete this release:
  * An introduction to the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards
  * A general discussion on how to secure the system landscape
  * Adding an authorization server to our system landscape
  * Protecting external communication with HTTPS
  * Securing access to the discovery service, Netflix Eureka
  * Authenticating and authorizing API access using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
  * Testing with the local authorization server
  * Testing with an OpenID Connect provider, Auth0
- We will understand the difference authentication mode implemented in this release such as:
 * **Authorization Code grant flow:** This is the safest, but also the most complex, grant flow. 
  This grant flow requires that the user interact with the authorization server using a web browser 
  for authentication and giving consent to the client application
 * **Implicit grant flow:** This flow is also web browser-based, but intended for client applications 
   that are not able to keep a client secret protected, for example, a single-page web application. 
   It gets an access token back from the authorization server instead of a grant code, but cannot 
   request a refresh token, since it is using the implicit grant flow that is less secure than the code grant flow.
 * **Resource Owner Password Credentials grant flow:** If a client application can't interact with a web browser, 
   it can fall back on this grant flow. In this grant flow, the user must share their credentials with 
   the client application and the client application will use these credentials to acquire an access token. 
 * **Client Credentials grant flow:** In the case where a client application needs to call an API unrelated to a specific user, 
   it can use this grant flow to acquire an access token using its own client ID and client secret.
   - check inside the following files to see what have changed:
    The common build file, ``settings.gradle``.
    The three Docker Compose files, ``docker-compose*.yml``.
    The edge server, spring-cloud/gateway:
    A health check has been added to ``HealthCheckConfiguration``.
    A route for URIs starting with ``/oauth/`` has been added
    and few new classes added and test modified to support ``oauth2``
 * **Getting started with Open Connect ID OAuth0:** follow the below instruction:
     [setting OAuth2 Account](../assets/setting_OAuht2_accaount.md)
     - Applying the new uir.set in the ``properties.yml`` in ``gateway`` and ``product-composit``
       ``spring.security.oauth2.resourceserver.jwt.issuer-uri: https://${TENANT_DOMAIN_NAME}/``
     - see [tag version V1.0.4.1](https://github.com/alexb760/product-recomendation/releases/tag/v1.0.4.1-cap11) to test it separated

## Added Feature:
1. Setting up a Spring Authentication.
2. Setting up local Open connect Id.
3. Setting up local certificate to use HTTPS only for development process.
4. Setting up alternative Open Connect Id [tag version V1.0.4.1](https://github.com/alexb760/product-recomendation/releases/tag/v1.0.4.1-cap11)
5. Securing Eureka server.
6. Create a local certificate only for development proposes.

## Setup

### Manual Test
1. clone project
2. created self-signed certificated.
    ````shell
        mkdir -p spring-cloud/authorization-server/src/main/resources/keystore
        mkdit keystore
        
        # both directories execute below command.
        # leaves all by default when keytool ask.
        keytool -genkeypair -alias localhost -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -storetype PKCS12 -keystore edge.p12 -validity 3650
    ````
3. build project and build docker images:
    ````shell
    ./gradlew build && docker-compose build
    ````
### Automated Test
1. Running all services.
   ````shell
   ./test_them_all.sh start
   ````
   Now our Eureka server has been secured by Oauth2 you will need to provide user and password if you want to see 
   all the service registered `http://localhost:8443/eureka/web` eureka-server. Notice we are 
   getting access to eureka server from port :8443 this is our new Age server and the routes we set up.
   
2. Acquiring access token using **password grant flow**:
    ````shell
   #writer
   curl -k https://writer:secret@localhost:8443/oauth/token -d grant_type=password -d username=magnus -d password=password -s | jq .
   export ACCESS_TOKEN=eyJ...SyIlQ
   #Reader
   curl -k https://reader:secret@localhost:8443/oauth/token -d grant_type=password -d username=magnus -d password=password -s | jq .
   ````
3. Acquiring access token using **implicit grant flow**:
   - **Writer:**
   in the browser ``https://localhost:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=reader&redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri&scope=product:read&state=48532``
   type user ```magnus``` and password ``password`` Authorize the process it will redirect to a link page:
   ``http://my.redirect.uri/#access_token=eyJh...C8pw&token_type=bearer&state=48532&expires_in=599999999&jti=8956b38b-36ea-4888-80dc-685b49f20f91``
   notice it has the access token yo can use it from here as authenticated user.
   - **Reader:** ``https://localhost:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=token&client_id=writer&redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri&scope=product:read+product:write&state=95372``
4. Acquiring acces token using **Code grant flow:** the most secure in OAuth 2.0.
   - **Reader:** ``https://localhost:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=reader&redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri&scope=product:read&state=35725``
   will answer with ``rect.uri/?code=T2pxvW&state=72489`` extract the code and ``CODE=T2pxvW`` now:
   ````shell
    curl -k https://reader:secret@localhost:8443/oauth/token \
    -d grant_type=authorization_code \
    -d client_id=reader \
    -d redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri \
    -d code=$CODE -s | jq .
    ````
   will return a access token.
   - **Writer:** ``https://localhost:8443/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=writer&redirect_uri=http://my.redirect.uri&scope=product:read+product:write&state=72489``
5. Calling protected API using access token.
   ````shell
    ACCESS_TOKEN={a-reader-access-token}
    curl https://localhost:8443/product-composite/2 -k -H "Authorization: Bearer $ACCESS_TOKEN" -i
   ````

### Testing out previous even-driven and reactive call implementations     
All ``docker-compose_**`` where update already must work as before but now with secured APIs.
