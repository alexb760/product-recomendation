# Release Note for V. 1.0.3-cap11

## What is new? 
#### Securing access to APIs.
- We are implementing OAuths and openID connect authentication and authorized user and client app
  to access our APIs.
- Following all the needed step to complete this release:
  * An introduction to the OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect standards
  * A general discussion on how to secure the system landscape
  * Adding an authorization server to our system landscape
  * Protecting external communication with HTTPS
  * Securing access to the discovery service, Netflix Eureka
  * Authenticating and authorizing API access using OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect
  * Testing with the local authorization server
  * Testing with an OpenID Connect provider, Auth0


 ## Documentation:
* [Spring 2.5.3 doc Oauth 2.0 ](https://docs.spring.io/spring-security-oauth2-boot/docs/2.5.3-SNAPSHOT/reference/html5/)

## Added Feature:
1. Setting up a Spring Cloud Gateway server.
2. Moving Health call to gateWayServer.
3. Setting up Docker Compose so that not to expose Eureka and Composite service.
4. Setting up Gateway server properties and routes. 

## Setup
### Manual Test
1. clone project
2. build project and build docker images:
    ````shell
    ./gradlew build && docker-compose build
    ````
### Automated Test
1. Running all services.
   ````shell
   ./test_them_all.sh start
   ````
   after running the command you can see the eureka server up and running in a matter of seconds 
   all the service will be registered [http://localhost:8080/eureka/web] eureka-server Notice we are 
   getting access to eureka server from port :8080 this is our new Age server and the routes we set up.
   
2. Verifying the new product was created accordingly:
    ````shell
    curl localhost:8080/product-composite/2 -s | jq .
    ````
   
3. Crashing our eureka service.
   ````shell
   docker-compose up -d --scale review=2 --scale eureka=0
   ````
   testing:
   ````shell
    curl localhost:8080/product-composite/2 -s | jq -r .serviceAddresses.rev
   ````
  Also, we have scaled down the review service as a result of the response we will see some time a 
  positive response and from time to time a empty response this happens because of Eureka server is
  down, but our composite-service has a cache where stored all the information provided by Eureka server.
  However, we shot down an instance of review-service and this could not be registered as down in eureka
  nor in composite-service that's why fails from time to time, this can be handled by applying resilience.

4. restoring Eureka-server.
   ````shell
   docker-compose up -d --scale product=2 --scale eureka=1
   ````
   All service should register again after a couple of seconds.

### Testing out previous even-driven and reactive call implementations     
3. Run docker compose RabbitMQ.
   
   3.1. run the application using RabbitMQ:
    ````shell
    docker-compose up
    ````
    3.2. run the applications using RabbitMQ partitions:
    ````shell
    export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose-partitons.yml
    docker-compose build && docker-compose up
    ````
    3.3. check or monitoring RabbitMQ http://localhost:15672/  user:guest pass:guest
4. Run the application using Kafka:
    ````shell
    export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose-kafka.yml
    docker-compose build && docker-compose up
    # list all container created
    docker ps 
    ````
    4.1 checking all kafka topics were created:
    ````shell
    docker exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper zookeeper --topic products
    docker exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper zookeeper --topic recommendations
    docker exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper zookeeper --topic reviews
    ````
   4.2. Checking the messages pushed. It will get outputs after executing step 5:
   ````shell
   # products
   # recommendations
   # reviews
   docker-compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic products --from-beginning --timeout-ms 1000
   # or from a specific partition:
   docker-compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic products --from-beginning --timeout-ms 1000 --partition 1
    ````
5. Testing out the application:
    ````shell
    cd product-recomendation
    curl -X POST localhost:8080/product-composite -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @product-data.json |jq .
    ````
6. Verifying the new product was created accordingly:
    ````shell
    curl localhost:8080/product-composite/2 -s | jq .
    ````
7. Stopping all services:
   ````shell
   docker-compose down --remove-orphans
   unset COMPOSE_FILE
   ````
