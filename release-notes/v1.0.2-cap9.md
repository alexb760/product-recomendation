# Release Note for V. 1.0.2-cap9
## What is new? 
- Implementing Eureka server and allow all microservice communicate to our Eureka server
- Implementing three pre-fixes of Eureka. eureka.server, eureka.client, eureka.instance.
  we are using Spring Cloud components.
- Implementing a couple of microservice patters
  1. Service discovery.
  2. Load balancer.
  3. Server register. 
 - further information about many Eureka server configuration. [https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-netflix/docs/current/reference/html/] Eureka.
     

## Added Feature:
1. Setting up a Netflix Eureka server.
2. Connecting microservices to a Netflix Eureka server
3. Setting up configuration for use in the development process
4. Trying out the discovery service.
5. Refactoring Unit Test to pass skipping Eureka-server instantiation. 

## Setup
### Manual Test
1. clone project
2. build project and build docker images:
    ````shell
    ./gradlew build && docker-compose build
    ````
### Automated Test
1. Running all services.
   ````shell
   ./test_them_all.sh start
   ````
   after running the command you can see the eureka server up and running in a matter of seconds 
   all the service will be registered [http://localhost:8761/] eureka-server.
   
2. scaling up to 3 instances of review services.
   ````shell
   docker-compose up -d --scale review=3
   ````
   after finishing a seconds we can see the new 2 instances registered in eureka-server.
   testing:
   ````shell
    curl localhost:8080/product-composite/2 -s | jq -r .serviceAddresses.rev
   ````
   Each time we call it the review address will be different that means aur Load-Balancer is working.
   
3. Crashing our eureka service.
   ````shell
   docker-compose up -d --scale review=2 --scale eureka=0
   ````
   testing:
   ````shell
    curl localhost:8080/product-composite/2 -s | jq -r .serviceAddresses.rev
   ````
  Also, we have scaled down the review service as a result of the response we will see some time a 
  positive response and from time to time a empty response this happens because of Eureka server is
  down, but our composite-service has a cache where stored all the information provided by Eureka server.
  However, we shot down an instance of review-service and this could not be registered as down in eureka
  nor in composite-service that's why fails from time to time, this can be handled by applying resilience.

4. restoring Eureka-server.
   ````shell
   docker-compose up -d --scale product=2 --scale eureka=1
   ````
   All service should register again after a couple of seconds.

### Testing out previous even-driven and reactive call implementations     
3. Run docker compose RabbitMQ.
   
   3.1. run the application using RabbitMQ:
    ````shell
    docker-compose up
    ````
    3.2. run the applications using RabbitMQ partitions:
    ````shell
    export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose-partitons.yml
    docker-compose build && docker-compose up
    ````
    3.3. check or monitoring RabbitMQ http://localhost:15672/  user:guest pass:guest
4. Run the application using Kafka:
    ````shell
    export COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose-kafka.yml
    docker-compose build && docker-compose up
    # list all container created
    docker ps 
    ````
    4.1 checking all kafka topics were created:
    ````shell
    docker exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper zookeeper --topic products
    docker exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper zookeeper --topic recommendations
    docker exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --zookeeper zookeeper --topic reviews
    ````
   4.2. Checking the messages pushed. It will get outputs after executing step 5:
   ````shell
   # products
   # recommendations
   # reviews
   docker-compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic products --from-beginning --timeout-ms 1000
   # or from a specific partition:
   docker-compose exec kafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic products --from-beginning --timeout-ms 1000 --partition 1
    ````
5. Testing out the application:
    ````shell
    cd product-recomendation
    curl -X POST localhost:8080/product-composite -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d @product-data.json |jq .
    ````
6. Verifying the new product was created accordingly:
    ````shell
    curl localhost:8080/product-composite/2 -s | jq .
    ````
7. Stopping all services:
   ````shell
   docker-compose down --remove-orphans
   unset COMPOSE_FILE
   ````
